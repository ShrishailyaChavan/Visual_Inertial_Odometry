# Visual Inertial Odometry

## Data

Used the Machine Hall 01 easy or (MH_01_easy) subset of the [EuRoC dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) to test our implementation. Please download the data in ASL data format from [here](https://www.google.com). Here, the data is collected using a VI sensor carried by a quadrotor flying a trajectory. The ground truth is provided by a sub-mm accurate Vicon Motion capture system.
